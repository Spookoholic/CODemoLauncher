# CODemoLauncher
A fork of the STODemoLauncher by rachelgarrett and RadioActivitii with the goal of making the program support Champions Online and its features.


## Description:

The Champions Online Demo Launcher will help you to inspect, manage, and run your demo files recorded in "Champions Online". This tool is not endorsed or supported by Cryptic Studios, Perfect World Entertainment, or DECA Games.

Features:
* Manage and play back Champions Online demo files
* Edit and filter demos
* Render demos to image sequences
* Access screen shot and demo directories with ease
* Swap costumes of any character

### Known Issues

* Auto-updating is currently disabled.
* When replacing costumes, every costume is listed twice. **Use the second instance of a listed costume when swapping to ensure the swap works.**
* Some various holdover features for editing Star Trek demos that don't serve an apparent purpose when dealing with Champions Online demos.
